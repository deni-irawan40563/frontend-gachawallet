<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Gacha Wallet is payment gateways website that makes it easy for users to make transactions online and make payments anytime and anywhere.
This website also ensures your data is safe in our database and we will encrypt any data that you send to us.

Here's why:

- Great responsive display for any device
- Does not reload pages when moving between pages
- made with all the latest and most up-to-date tools and technology today
- great performance
- specially designed for payment gateways web needs
- reusable components


Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
